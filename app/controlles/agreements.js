                   echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/7.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list

The command adds the MongoDB 7.0 sources list file to the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory. This file contains a single line that reads:

deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/7.0 multiverse

add mongodb repo

Once the repository is added, reload the local package index.

sudo apt update

The command refreshes the local repositories and makes Ubuntu aware of the newly added MongoDB 7.0 repository.

With that out of the way, install the mongodb-org meta-package that provides MongoDB.

sudo apt install mongodb-org -y

install mongodb

The command installs the MongoDB database server along with the database core components including the shell tools. Once the installation is complete, verify the version of MongoDB installed:

 mongod --version

check mongodb version

This lists a bunch of information including the version, Git, and OPenSSL version among other details.
#
Step 2: Start MongoDB service

The MongoDB service is disabled upon installation by default, and you can verify this by running the below command:

sudo systemctl status mongod

check mongodb process status

To start the MongoDB service, execute the command:

sudo systemctl start mongod

Once again, confirm if the service is running:

sudo systemctl status mongod

check mongodb process status

From the above output, you can see that MongoDB is up and running. Additionally, you can confirm that the database is up and running by checking if the server is listening on its default port which is port 27017.

To do so, run the following ss command:

$ sudo ss -pnltu | grep 27017

You should see the following output on your terminal.

check active ports for mongodb

After you have verified the service is running as expected, you can now enable MongoDB to start on boot as shown.

sudo systemctl enable mongod

enable mongodb process upon system startup

So far, MongoDB has successfully been installed and configured to start on boot.
#
Step 3: Create MongoDB database and user

By now, your MongoDB instance should be running and configured for remote access. Letâ€™s shift gears and explore how to create a database and a user in MongoDB.

To access MongoDB, run the command:

mongosh

Before you drop to the MongoDB shell, you will see some details about MongoDB, like the version of MongoDB and MongoDB shell and the URL for the Mongosh documentation.

Above the Mongo shell prompt, you will also see a warning suggesting that access control hasn't been enabled for the database and that read and write access to data and configuration is restricted. This warning is displayed because authentication hasn't been enabled yet - it will disappear after authentication to the database is enabled.

check mongodb status information

Three databases are created upon installation by default. These are admin, config, and local. To list the existing databases, run the command:

show dbs

show mongodb databases

To create a database, invoke the use command followed by the database name. For instance, to create a database called employees run the command:

use employees

To confirm the database you are currently in, run the db command. In this case, you will get employees as the output.

db

confirm the database

MongoDB provides several shell methods for managing your database. The db.createUser method allows you to create a new user in a database.

This method requires you to define the username and password of the user and any roles you wish to grant the user. This information is presented in JSON format.

Here is the syntax of creating a user called cherry with read and write roles on the employees database.

db.createUser(
  {
    user: "cherry",
    pwd: "some_password",
    roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "employees" } ]
  }
)

create a new mongodb user

You can list the users created using the db.getUsers() method.

db.getUsers();

Output:

check all mongodb users

Alternatively, run the command:

show users

Output:

get mongodb users

To delete the user, use the db.dropUser method as shown.

db.dropUser("cherry", {w: "majority", wtimeout: 4000})

Output:

{ ok: 1 }

delete a mongodb user
#
Step 4: Secure MongoDB on Ubuntu

Authentication is not enabled by default in MongoDB, implying that any user with access to the database server can view, add, and delete data. This vulnerability can cause a serious breach of your data, which is why it is important to secure MongoDB. In this section, we will demonstrate how you can secure MongoDB on Ubuntu 22.04.

As the first step, you need to create an administrative user and to do so, first access the Mongo Shell.

mongosh

As the next step, connect or switch to the admin database.

use admin

Then, create the database user by pasting these lines and hitting ENTER on the keyboard.

db.createUser(
  {
    user: "AdminCherry",
    pwd: passwordPrompt(),
    roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }, "readWriteAnyDatabase" ]
 }
)

Letâ€™s break down this code.

The user: "AdminCherry" line creates an Administrative user called AdminCherry.

The pwd: passwordPrompt() method prompts you for the administrative userâ€™s password. It is a safer alternative to the pwd: field, which requires you to type the password in cleartext.

The roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }, "readWriteAnyDatabase" ] line defines the roles granted to the administrative user. Here, the Administrative user is granted read and write permissions to the admin database. Since this role is defined in the admin database, the administrative user, as a result, can read and modify all the databases in the cluster.

Here is the output after running the command.

create mongodb user

Run the exit command or press CTRL + C to exit from the Mongo Shell.

With the Admin user in place, the next step is to enable authentication. For this, exit the MongoDB shell and open the mongod.conf file.

sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf

Scroll down and find the security section. Uncomment it, add the authorization directive, and set it to enabled.


security:
    authorization: enabled

Note that the authorization parameter is indented while security has no space at the beginning.

Next, save the changes and exit from the configuration file. To apply the changes, restart MongoDB as shown.

sudo systemctl restart mongod

Furthermore, check if the service is running as expected.

sudo systemctl status mongod

Now login to Mongo Shell.

mongosh

This time, you will see that the startup warnings have disappeared.

check mongodb status information

However, if you try to perform any database-related task, like viewing databases, you will get some output suggesting that authentication is required.

show dbs

show mongodb databases

To authenticate, first, log out of the Mongo Shell by running the exit command. Then log in using the administrative user as follows.

mongosh -u AdminCherry -p --authenticationDatabase admin

Enter the administrative user's password, and this time, the authentication warnings you encountered before will have disappeared.

Authenticate with your user

From here on, only the administrative user can view, create, and modify the data in the database. To exit the shell, run the exit command.
#
Step 5: Configure MongoDB for remote access

MongoDB is set to be accessed locally on the same server it was installed on by default, and to enable remote access, you must edit the /etc/mongod.conf file, the main configuration file for MongoDB.

This file contains settings for the database storage location, logging, networking, and process management.

You can access the configuration file using your text editor.

sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf  

Locate the network interfaces section and pay attention to the bindIP value.

# network interfaces
net:
  port: 27017
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1

By default, MongoDB is bound to 127.0.0.1, the loopback address interface, which implies that MongoDB can only accept connections from the same server where it was installed.

Add a comma followed by the Mongo serverâ€™s IP address to allow remote access.

  bindIp: 127.0.0.1, mongo-server-ip

Next, save the changes and exit the configuration file. To apply these changes, restart MongoDB.

sudo systemctl restart mongod

If UFW is enabled, run the following command to allow incoming connections from a remote machine.

sudo ufw allow from remote_machine_ip to any port 27017

To effect the changes, reload the firewall.

sudo ufw reload

#
Step 6: Access MongoDB remotely

There are a couple of ways to access the MongoDB shell remotely. You can use the Netcat utility to initiate a TCP connection to port 27017, the default port that MongoDB listens to.

If it still needs to be installed on the client machine, install Netcat as follows.

sudo apt install netcat

Next, to establish a connection to the MongoDB server via port 27017, run the following command:

nc -zv mongodb_server_ip 27017

The following output indicates that the connection was successful.

Output:

Connection to mongodb_server_ip 27017 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

Test mongodb connection

Alternatively, you can log in using Mongo Shell as follows.

mongosh "mongodb://username@mongo_server_ip:27017"

The shell automatically prompts you for the admin userâ€™s password.

Authenticate with your user

    NOTE: for this to work, ensure that the version of Mongo shell is the same both on the client and remote MongoDB server.

#
Step 7: How to use MongoDB - working with the MongoDB database

There are a number of database operations that you can carry out in MongoDB. For example, you can create, retrieve, update, and delete records from a database.
#
1. Inserting data

To create a document in a collection, use the .insertOne() method. This method supports several data types, like strings, integers, boolean values, and arrays.

In the previous step, we created a test database called employees. Now, we will create a collection and add a few documents - a collection contains one or more documents.

So, once again, log in to the MongoDB server with authentication:

mongosh -u AdminCherry -p --authenticationDatabase admin

Switch to the employees database.

use employees

Run the following command which creates a collection called staff and adds a document with employee user data.

db.staff.insertOne({ name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "London", married: true, hobbies: ["Travelling", "Swimming", "Cooking"] })

The command displays the following output, acknowledging the insertion of data.

Output:

{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedId: ObjectId("64f799b4a974192c06cdce9f")
}

Insert data into mongodb
#
2. Retrieving data

With a document already created in the staff collection, you can retrieve it and filter the results using the .find() method.

For example, to retrieve all the documents in the staff collection, run the following command:

db.staff.find()

Output:

[
  {
    _id: ObjectId("62647ff866c1f054568a11b5"),
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 25,
    city: 'London',
    married: true,
    hobbies: [ 'Travelling', 'Swimming', 'Cooking' ]
  }
]

Retrieve data from mongodb

Now, letâ€™s try adding a few more documents and run a few queries on the collection.

db.staff.insertOne({ name: "Bob", age: 29, city: "Liverpool", married: false, hobbies: ["Hiking", "Watching movies", "Driving"] })

db.staff.insertOne({ name: "Winnie", age: 25, city: "Bristol", married: true, hobbies: ["Playing chess", "Surfing", "Painting"] })

Insert even more data into mongodb

To query records of employees who are married, run the command.

db.staff.find({ married: true })

The output provides records of married employees only.

Output:

[
  {
    _id: ObjectId("62647ff866c1f054568a11b5"),
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 25,
    city: 'London',
    married: true,
    hobbies: [ 'Travelling', 'Swimming', 'Cooking' ]
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId("626483d6b490694bc675b767"),
    name: 'Winnie',
    age: 25,
    city: 'Bristol',
    married: true,
    hobbies: [ 'Playing chess', 'Surfing', 'Painting' ]
  }
]

Get some data from mongodb
#
3. Updating data

To update or modify records, use the .update() method. In this example, we demonstrate how you can change the name value of the second record from Bob to Robert.

db.staff.update({ name: "Bob" }, {$set: { name: "Robert" }})

The output shown confirms that the update of the record was successful.

Output:

{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedId: null,
  matchedCount: 1,
  modifiedCount: 1,
  upsertedCount: 0
}

Update a single mongodb entry

You can now query to see if you can find a record that matches the name Robert as follows.

db.staff.find({ name: "Robert" })

Output:

[
  {
    _id: ObjectId("64f7a050a974192c06cdcea0"),
    name: 'Robert',
    age: 29,
    city: 'Liverpool',
    married: false,
    hobbies: [ 'Hiking', 'Watching movies', 'Driving' ]
  }
]

Check updated data
#
4. Deleting data

MongoDB shell provides two methods for deleting records:

.deleteOne()
.deleteMany() 

The .deleteOne() method is used to delete a single record or document from a collection. For example, to delete Robertâ€™s record, run the following query.

db.staff.deleteOne({ name: "Robert"})

The .deleteMany() method deletes multiple documents from a collection.

    NOTE The recommended way to remove a single record is by using the recordâ€™s _id value. This is a unique value given to each record and is preferred over defining individual entries such as name:'Robert', which would result in the deletion of all records bearing the name Robert.

To safely delete Robertâ€™s record without unintentionally deleting other records with the same entry, specify the _id value instead.

db.staff.deleteOne({ _id: ObjectId("64f7a050a974192c06cdcea0")})

Output:

{ acknowledged: true, deletedCount: 1 }

Additionally, you can delete documents based on a certain criterion. In this case, use the .deleteMany() method for deleting multiple records.

For example, to delete all documents in the staff collection where employees are married, run the command:

db.staff.deleteMany({married: true})

Output:

{ acknowledged: true, deletedCount: 1 }

Delete many entries from mongodb

To delete all the documents in the collection, use the deleteMany() method without arguments:

db.staff.deleteMany({ })

If you try querying the collection, you will see that the output will be blank, which is a clear indication that all the documents have been deleted and that the collection is now empty.

Delete all data from mongodb
